# Rethinking in react 



## Description

As the official documentation of react says "One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them." * [Thinking in React](http://www.https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) - However the code they show uses classes as it have been done in React, My attempt with this repository is to grab that code and implement a "rethink" on the code using the new feature available since react 16.8 called React Hooks, not only because it's new but because it helps to solve some problems like the ["Wraper Hell"] and an intensive use of ["Props Drilling"] in which I have been involved with both underlining the problem of manteinance and re-use.

In the past we had been warned not to use [Context], but since the version 16.8 it's stable and it offer us a new way about thinking in react and programming as well,my attempt with this code is to be able to refactor the code using the new feature of React hook and it's advantages
